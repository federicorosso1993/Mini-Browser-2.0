# How to install Mini Browser 2?

To install Mini Browser 2 you need to download the installer and type a password <br>
To get the password you will need to make a donation with paypal (the minimum is 5,99â‚¬), <br> 
write you email in the note and I will send you the code to install Mini Browser 2 (each password is unique so if you share it you can be identified, each update you will get a new key on the email you wrote in the note the first time and a download link for your personal installer): 

<a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=QJBK2R2Q3Z28U">

</a>

Note: if in the future too many people buy the app for me to handle this key system I'll just keep one key for everyone. At that point the development of this app will be repaid.
Of course you will still not legally be able to share this to anyone.

Even with this system you are able to install this app multiple times on multiple device without internet connection anywhere. There is no DRM on the installed app, no internet drm on the installer. This is still DRM-free even with the password needed for the installer. The password is there just to repay the development time and be able to use my time to improve this app.

You can try the Microsoft store version (without the download function) for 7 days here (you can also buy that version from there):
